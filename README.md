# Part and Partial
Can we partially reload only certain parts of a site per request?

Specifically, can we use Inertia's lazy-load feature to independently update only specific components on a page?

## Getting started
Simply clone the repo, install your composer and npm dependencies, and `sail up -d`. 

You should be able to visit the site at `localhost:8080`.
